## About

**CS junior @ Purdue University** — Machine Intelligence track, Mathematics minor. Currently **SWE Intern @ Qualcomm**, where I architect an autonomous, agentic crash-triage pipeline: an LLM-driven tool-use loop that ingests raw modem crash reports, autonomously resolves build artifacts, retrieves source context, and localizes root cause before a human engineer ever opens the log.

> **The thesis behind everything I build:** LLMs stop being toys and start being infrastructure the moment you give them tools, guardrails, and a reason to act. *I design that layer.*

Off the keyboard: **Project Team Lead @ ML@Purdue** · **Marketing Lead @ Girls Who Code Purdue**

### [Figment](https://github.com/mneha05/figment) — Self-Play Market-Making Arena for Figgie

> `[ market microstructure ] [ Bayesian inference ] [ evolutionary self-play ]`

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mneha05/figment/main/assets/replay.gif" width="90%" alt="Figment — one Figgie round replayed: suit prices, the market maker's live Bayesian belief, and P&L"/>
  <br/>
  <sub><b>↑ live from the repo:</b> one real round replayed — suit prices, the maker's belief converging on the hidden goal suit, and P&amp;L. &nbsp;·&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/mneha05/figment">open the repo →</a></sub>
</p>

A from-scratch engine for **Figgie** — the trading card game Jane Street invented to teach market intuition — plus AI traders that have to *reason about a hidden market* rather than pattern-match one. Underneath sits a **continuous double auction** with four independent order books, price-time priority, and exact settlement, and on top of it a **Bayesian market maker** that infers which suit secretly scores from its private hand and the order flow it observes — an exact **multivariate-hypergeometric posterior**, no black box — then prices every card at expected value and quotes a two-sided market **Avellaneda–Stoikov style**, skewing against inventory and widening its spread with belief entropy. An **evolutionary self-play** loop *learns* a market-making strategy from a deliberately timid start (**+\$6/game → +\$37/game** over 14 generations), and a multiplayer **Elo tournament** ranks the field. The result that makes the whole thing click: the noise traders **win the pot more often** yet **lose money every game** — because they overpay for it. *Edge ≠ outcome*, which is the entire game. Deterministic under a seed and pinned by **15 tests** asserting the market never creates or destroys a card or a dollar.

### [PARALLAX](https://github.com/mneha05/parallax) — Multi-Agent Reliability Investigation Platform

> `[ agentic orchestration ] [ multi-agent systems ] [ autonomous investigation ]`

A hierarchical multi-agent system built on the **orchestrator-workers pattern**: a director agent decomposes reliability incidents into a task graph and **fans out to specialized statistical worker agents in parallel**, each operating with an isolated toolset and context. Results fan back in through a **cross-validation layer** that reconciles conflicting findings before synthesis — because a multi-agent system without verification is just N chances to hallucinate. Handles failure isolation per-worker (one agent dying doesn't kill the investigation) and produces structured, evidence-linked root-cause reports. It's the difference between an LLM that *summarizes* an incident and a system that *investigates* one: hypothesis generation, statistical testing, dead-end pruning — autonomously.

### [VibeGraph](https://github.com/mneha05/vibegraphv1) — Bidirectional Code-Canvas Workflow IDE

> `[ AI workflow tooling ] [ real-time bidirectional sync ] [ static analysis ]`

An IDE for agentic workflows where **YAML source and a visual DAG are two projections of one canonical state** — edit either, and a **bidirectional reconciliation engine** syncs them in real time without drift or destructive rewrites. The interesting engineering lives underneath: a **custom static analyzer** performs variable scope resolution and data-flow validation across workflow steps, catching broken references *before* execution — compiler techniques applied to workflow definitions. A **step-through simulator** works like a debugger for agent pipelines (breakpoints, state inspection, deterministic replay), and layout is handled by **ELK's layered graph algorithm** for readable auto-arrangement of arbitrary DAGs. Shipped with **33 passing tests** across the sync engine and analyzer, because developer tooling doesn't get to be flaky.

### [Sentinel](https://github.com/mneha05/sentinel) — AI-Driven Sensor Anomaly Workbench

> `[ anomaly detection ] [ AI decision support ] [ real-time telemetry ]`

A multi-channel anomaly triage workbench that ingests **streaming sensor telemetry** and layers AI-driven decision support on top — classifying deviations as noise, drift, or imminent failure, with **cross-channel correlation** to distinguish a failing sensor from a failing system. Designed around a production-reliability truth: **alert fatigue kills monitoring systems faster than missed alerts do.** Every flag ships with its supporting evidence, correlated channels, and a recommended action, keeping the human in the loop *deciding* instead of *deciphering*. Explainability isn't a feature here — it's the architecture.

### [MERIDIAN](https://github.com/mneha05/meridian) — Zero-Backend Self-Service BI Platform

> `[ analytics infrastructure ] [ in-browser compute ] [ data democratization ]`

A full business-intelligence platform with a deliberately contrarian architecture: **the entire compute layer moved client-side.** An in-browser SQL engine (AlaSQL) executes queries directly over uploaded datasets, and visualization runs on a **charting engine hand-rolled from raw SVG primitives** — no chart library, no rendering dependency, full control over every pixel and every render pass. The result: **zero backend, zero infrastructure cost, zero data leaving the user's machine** — a privacy-preserving analytics loop that collapses upload → query → visualize into a single client-side artifact. Built to interrogate a real systems tradeoff: how much of the modern data stack is architecture, and how much is habit?

### [PipelineForge](https://github.com/mneha05/pipelineforge) — Visual Data Pipeline Architect

> `[ dataflow systems ] [ visual programming ] [ pipeline orchestration ]`

A visual environment that models data pipelines as **typed, composable DAGs** — connect stages, trace **data lineage end-to-end**, and validate topology before anything touches production data. The design bet: pipeline failures are overwhelmingly *architecture* failures (implicit dependencies, untracked lineage, silent schema drift), so the tool makes the architecture inspectable first-class — you reason about the graph, not the glue code.

### [GridLens](https://github.com/mneha05/gridlens) — High-Velocity Data Exploration

> `[ interactive analytics ] [ frontend performance engineering ]`

Tabular data exploration engineered around a single latency budget: **interaction must never lag behind thought.** Filtering, slicing, and pattern-hunting across datasets with a front-end architecture tuned for render performance — because the moment an exploratory tool makes the analyst wait, the exploration ends. An exercise in treating **UI latency as a systems problem**, not a styling problem.

`TypeScript` `Next.js` `interaction-latency optimization` `render performance`

---

### [QueryDesk](https://github.com/mneha05/querydesk) — Conversational Analytics Workspace

> `[ natural-language data access ] [ query UX ]`

A workspace built for the pattern every data tool is converging on: **the query interface is a conversation, not a syntax exam.** Ask in natural language, refine iteratively, drill down — collapsing the distance between a question and its answer for users who shouldn't need to know what a LEFT JOIN is to get one.
